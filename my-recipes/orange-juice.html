    <h1>ORANGE JUICE</h1>

    <p>
        Fresh orange juice takes a little work, but it tastes much better than orange juice from concentrate. <br>
        I came up with this recipe in response to a request about how to make fresh-squeezed orange juice. <br>
        You may also use a citrus reamer to do this. If you want less pulp, use a hand juicer with a strainer. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>4 oranges</li>
            <li>Sugar(optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Steps To Make Fresh Orange Juice</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly smack each orange on the counter. </li>
            <li>Cut each orange in half and squeeze juice into a glass.</li>
            <li>Add Sugar to taste(optional).</li>
        </ol>
